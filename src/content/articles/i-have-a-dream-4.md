Although Kubernetes provides official documentation to examine deprecated or removed APIs, identifying the resources in your cluster that utilize these APIs can be quite challenging.

On top of that, Kubernetes abides by a stringent API versioning protocol, resulting in multiple deprecations of v1beta1 and v2beta1 APIs across several releases. Their policy states that Beta API versions are mandated to receive support for a minimum of 9 months or 3 releases (whichever is longer) after deprecation, after which they may be subject to removal.

In cases where APIs that have been deprecated are still actively employed by workloads, tools, or other components interfacing with the cluster, disruptions may occur. Hence, it is imperative for users and administrators to conduct a thorough assessment of their cluster to identify any APIs in use slated for removal, and subsequently migrate the affected components to leverage the appropriate new API version.

Merely listing your Kubernetes resources using kubectl commands may yield inaccurate API version information, as explained in this issue.
